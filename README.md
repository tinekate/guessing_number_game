Guess the Number of Lemons (Number Guessing Game)

The program (C#) will ask the user to input any number from 1 to 100 under 10 attempts and if the user guesses a number, the output will display if the number is too high or Low from the target number. If the user guesses the right number, the player wins, otherwise the player loses. The program generates a random number to be guessed by the player. Every turn is equivalent to 1 guess including the invalid inputs.
